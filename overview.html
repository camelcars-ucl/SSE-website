    <h2 class="w3-wide">  Overview</h2>
    <p>Software engineering is the process of developing computer based software to benefit both industry and potentially society as a whole. </p>
    <p>The goal of software systems engineering is to develop software that is:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>	Target Driven – ensuring that software developed meets the set specification. This is essential in a commercial environment. This is also essential in areas such as avionic software engineering (software used in aeroplanes) where software produced is used to prevent harm coming to civilians.</li>

    <li>	Reliable – the ability to ensure that developed software has been thoroughly tested before deployment. This is to ensure both safety when used in practical scenarios and for software to essentially work as desired. This is to make sure users are not inconvenienced and potentially endangered.</li>

    <li>	Adaptable – The ability to improve software to meet the changing requirements of users/companies. It also provides the ability to innovate new features for pieces of software.</li>

    <li>	Safe - developed software is fundamentally safe when used in real life applications</li>

    <li>Economical -  ensuring that you are in full control of the costs when creating software. Ensuring this is managed in a commercial environment is critical to business.</li>

            <h1 style="font-size: 30px">Digital Music Lab</h3>
            <p>The Digital Music Lab project will develop research methods and software infrastructure for exploring and analysing large-scale music collections. A major output of the project will be a service infrastructure with two prototype installations. One installation will enable researchers, musicians and general users to explore, analyse and extract information from music recordings stored in the British Library.</p>
            <p>We will provide researchers with the tools to analyse music audio, scores and metadata. The combination of state-of-the art music analysis on the audio and the symbolic level with intelligent collection-level analysis methods will allow for exploration and quantitative research on music that has not been possible at this scale so far.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 30px">GISMO</h3>
            <p>Humans find it hard to develop systems that balance many competing and conficting operational objectives. Objective such as reponse time, throughput and computational resources must be optimized, but it is difficult for a programmer to do so</p>
            <p>Techniques are therefore required that can either automatically create code that balances many conficting objectives, or that can provide support to the human who tries to do so. The GISMO (Genetic Improvement of Software for Multiple Objectives) project seeks to do both.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">Past Projects</h2>
            <p style="padding-top: 20px">Since its inception, the SSE group at UCL has conducted a wide variety of impactful projects. Here are just a few of them</p>
            <hr>
            <h1 style="font-size: 30px">FITTEST : Future Internet Testing</h1>
            <p>In the future, software will dominate our lives, as we become incresingly dependent on it for public uitlities, social services, education, finance and business. As such, quality assurance techniques must keep up with the industry. However, given the growing complexity of technologies involved, this will prove more and more difficult</p>
            <p>The overall aim of the FITTEST project is to address these testing challenges, by developing an integrated environment for automated testing, which can monitor the Future Internet application under test and adapt to the dynamic changes observed. </p>
            <hr>
            <h1 style="font-size: 30px">Cancer Informatics</h1>
            <p>The NCRI Informatics Initiative has been established with the goal of using informatics to maximise the impact of cancer research. In order to achieve this goal, an informatics platform must be set up to facilitate movement and access to data generated by cancer research</p>
            <p>This project is a testbed for new techniques. However, it is also our collective contribution to defeating cancer which has taken the lives of our friends and family.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1 style="font-size: 30px">Children's Social Care</h1>
            <p>This project aims to investigate the potential for a larger, innovative project into the use of computing to support risk assessment in work with vulnerable children and their families.</p>
            <p>As with many other fields, this one deals with lots of data. However, computational tools used in this field fall far behind the others. We believe that techniques elsewhere can be applied here. In doing so, we will provide assistance to vulnerable children and their families.</p>
